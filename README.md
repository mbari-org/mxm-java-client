# MXM Java Client Library

This project's goal is to build a client library to allow tools and
applications on the JVM to interact with an MXM service.

**Status**:

- A preliminary version of the library is already available
  for initial testing (only informational queries at the moment).

- The MXM service itself, including its API, is also in a prototypical stage
  so the API in general is not stable.

## Using the library

The library as well as the javadoc (in a separate JAR) are made available at
https://github.com/mbari-org/mxm-java-client/releases/.

Besides the `mxm-java-client-x.y.z.jar` library, you will also need the
[Apache httpclient](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.httpcomponents/httpclient/4.5.10/jar)
and the
[Google Gson](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.8.6/jar)
libraries in your CLASSPATH.

As indicated in the included [demo program](mxm/src/main/java/MxmClientMain.java),
you will construct an instance of the `MxmClient` class providing the URL of the MXM endpoint,
and then make queries and requests as needed:

```java
MxmClient mxm = new MxmClient("http://mxm.shore.mbari.org/mxm-graphql");

// general info about providers:
List<Provider> providers = mxm.getProviders();
...
// more detailed info about a particular provider:
Optional<Provider> ox = mxm.getProvider("foo-provider");
...
// detailed info about a mission template:
Optional<MissionTemplate> omt = mxm.getProviderMissionTemplate("foo-provider", "bar-mtempl");
...
// detailed info about a mission:
Optional<Mission> omt = mxm.getMission("foo-provider", "bar-mtempl", "some-mission");
...
```

Part of the demo program's output is enclosed below.

## General information

The GUI of the current MXM service prototype is at http://mxm.shore.mbari.org/mxm/.

The corresponding MXM API endpoint is `http://mxm.shore.mbari.org/mxm-graphql`.

A [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) interface is available
at http://mxm.shore.mbari.org/mxm-graphiql.
This is **highly recommended** as a great tool for general inspection of the
available information, and in particular to then let us know about pieces of
information that should be included and/or that may not yet be visible through
this client library.

## Demo program

The following is part of the output generated by the included demo program
[`MxmClientMain`](mxm/src/main/java/MxmClientMain.java) when run
against the API endpoint indicated above:

```

## Release

General "release" steps:

Set `MXM_VERSION` as needed.

    mill mxm._
    cp out/mxm/jar/dest/out.jar    ./mxm-java-client-${MXM_VERSION}.jar
    cp out/mxm/docJar/dest/out.jar ./mxm-java-client-${MXM_VERSION}-javadoc.jar 

Then upload the artifacts to github.

### javadoc

    mill mxm.docJar
    JAR="mxm-java-client-${MXM_VERSION}-javadoc.jar"
    cp out/mxm/docJar/dest/out.jar ./mxm-java-client-${MXM_VERSION}-javadoc.jar
    scp ${JAR} mxmadmin@mxm.shore.mbari.org:/var/www/html/java-client-doc/javadoc.jar && \
    ssh mxmadmin@mxm.shore.mbari.org <<'EOF'
      cd /var/www/html/java-client-doc/
      unzip -o ./javadoc.jar
    EOF

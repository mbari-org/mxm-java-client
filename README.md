# MXM Java Client Library

This project's goal is to build a client library to allow tools and
applications on the JVM to interact with an MXM service.

**Status**: 

- A preliminary version of the library is already available 
  for initial testing (only informational queries at the moment).

- The MXM service itself, including its API, is also in a prototypical stage
  so the API in general is not stable.

## Using the library

The library as well as the javadoc (in a separate JAR) are made available at
https://github.com/mbari-org/mxm-java-client/releases/.

Besides the `mxm-java-client-x.y.z.jar` library, you will also need the
[Apache httpclient](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.httpcomponents/httpclient/4.5.10/jar)
and the
[Google Gson](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.8.6/jar)
libraries in your CLASSPATH.

As indicated in the included [demo program](mxm/src/main/java/MxmClientMain.java),
you construct an instance of the `MxmClient` class providing the URL of the MXM endpoint,
and then make queries and requests as needed:

```java
MxmClient mxm = new MxmClient("http://tsauv.shore.mbari.org/mxm-graphql");

// general info about executors:
List<Executor> executors = mxm.getExecutors();
...
// more detailed info about a particular executor:
Optional<Executor> ox = mxm.getExecutor("foo-executor");
...
// detailed info about a mission template:
Optional<MissionTemplate> omt = mxm.getExecutorMissionTemplate("foo-executor", "bar-mtempl");
...
// detailed info about a mission:
Optional<Mission> omt = mxm.getMission("foo-executor", "bar-mtempl", "some-mission");
...
```  

Part of the demo program's output is enclosed below.

## General information

The GUI of the current MXM service prototype is at http://tsauv.shore.mbari.org/mxm/.

The corresponding MXM API endpoint is `http://tsauv.shore.mbari.org/mxm-graphql`.

A [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) interface is available
at http://tsauv.shore.mbari.org/mxm-graphiql.

## Demo program

The following is part of the output generated by the included demo program 
[`MxmClientMain`](mxm/src/main/java/MxmClientMain.java) when run
against the API endpoint indicated above:
